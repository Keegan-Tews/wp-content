<h1>WordPress & PHP skill practice</h1>

<p>Within this repo are the files I made to complete the course work for the Udemy WordPress course. 
  Most of the files were made by me, but some were provided by the course. Mainly the CSS and some of the background javascript.</p>

<h2>Files not made by me</h2>

<ul>
  <li>src/modules/HeroSlider.js</li>
  <li>src/modules/MobileMenu.js</li>
  <li>build/index.js</li>
  <li>All CSS files</li>
</ul>
